# Multi-user Collaborative Whiteboard Application
## [live demo](onlinewhiteboardthesis.herokuapp.com/)
The intent of this application is to develop a system that allows multiple users to collaboratively draw on a whiteboard powered by tools provided by HTML5 and Socketio for communication. In this application, we want to attempt to minimize the stress the amount of expected data will put on the client's browser through effective data storing and utilizing technologies that would make transferring and receiving such data as as seemless as possible.

Clone it
```
git clone https://github.com/dodinhtrung97/multiuser-whiteboard

Install nodejs, babel, webpack and webpack-dev-server
```
npm i babel webpack webpack-dev-server
